        <h1> Biography</h1>
                <p>
            (Augusto Nicolás Calderón Sandino, Niquinohomo, Nicaragua, 1893 - Managua, 1934) Nicaraguan guerrilla
            leader who fought tenaciously against the US occupation and intervention to force the United States to
            withdraw its troops from Nicaragua. After his murder at the hands of the then head of the National Guard,
            Anastasio Somoza, Sandino became the ideological reference of the Sandinista National Liberation Front
            (FSLN) and the revolution promoted by this movement that, years later, would end the dictatorship
            Somocista.

            <br><br>
            Of very humble origin, Augusto Sandino worked as a miner in Nicaragua, Honduras and Mexico. In 1926 he
            returned to his country, occupied since 1916 by the American troops who defended the interests of the fruit
            companies of the United States. He opted to defend national autonomy, affected by the Bryan-Chamorro
            agreement and the signing of the Stimpson-Moncada treaty, for which he gathered a group of guerrillas and
            took up arms.
            <br><br>
            For six years Sandino fought against the troops of different governments supported by the United States, at
            the end of which he had managed to gather about three thousand men around him and had gained popular
            admiration. Organized under his command, the rebellious guerrilla took refuge in the jungles of Nueva
            Segovia, where it became practically invincible.
            <br><br>
            Failing to defeat him, US President Herbert C. Hoover ordered the withdrawal of troops deployed in
            Nicaragua, which, along with the election of Franklin D. Roosevelt as president of the United States, moved
            Sandino to negotiate with the Nicaraguan government the deposition of weapons and the return to civilian
            life (1933).
            <br><br>
            However, his political prestige continued to be a threat to the country's leaders, so, after accepting an
            invitation to go to the presidential palace, he was ambushed and killed by Anastasio Somoza, head of the
            National Guard and nephew of former President José María Moncada
            <br><br>
            However, the death of the leader did not mean the disappearance of his movement, and his name came to
            embody the liberation struggle of Nicaragua. The Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN), a political
            alignment created in 1962, was constituted as a continuation of Sandino's ideology and focused on the
            overthrow of the Somozas through armed struggle, an objective that would be achieved many years later (in
            1979) force the fall of President Anastasio Somoza Debayle, son of Anastasio Somoza
